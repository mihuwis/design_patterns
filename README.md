## Creational Desing Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

A **singleton** is a class that is instantiated only once. 
Typicali this is acomplished by creating static filed that represents that class.
Static method exist in the class to obtain instance of class. Typically we call this method getInstance() 
Singleton typicaly has private constructor to prevent this clas beeing instantiated via constructor
